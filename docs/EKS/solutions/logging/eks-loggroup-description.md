### /aws/containerinsights/cluster_name/application 

All applications logs stored under `/var/log/containers/*.log` are streamed into the dedicated log group. All non-application logs such as kube-proxy and aws-node logs are excluded by default. However, additional Kubernetes add-on logs, such as CoreDNS logs, are also processed and streamed into this log group.

- **`containerLogMaxSize`** default 10MB
- **`containerLogMaxFiles`** default 5


### /aws/containerinsights/cluster_name/dataplane

EKS already provides control plane logs. With Fluent Bit integration in Container Insights, the logs generated by EKS data plane components, which run on every worker node and are responsible for maintaining running pods are captured as data plane logs. These logs are also streamed into a dedicated CloudWatch log group under this log group. **kube-proxy**, **aws-node**, and Docker runtime logs are saved into this log group. In addition to control plane logs, having data plane logs stored in CloudWatch Logs helps to provide a complete picture of your EKS clusters.


### /aws/containerinsights/cluster_name/host

system logs for each EKS worker node are streamed into the log group. These system logs include the contents of `/var/log/messages, /var/log/dmesg, /var/log/secure` files. Considering the stateless and dynamic nature of containerized workloads, where EKS worker nodes are often being terminated during scaling activities, streaming those logs in real time with Fluent Bit and having those logs available in CloudWatch logs, even after the node is terminated, are critical in terms of observability and monitoring health of EKS worker nodes. It also enables you to debug or troubleshoot cluster issues without logging into worker nodes in many cases and analyze these logs in more systematic way.
